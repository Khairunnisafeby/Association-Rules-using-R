One implementation of data mining is the Apriori Algorithm. 

Apriori algorithm is a method for finding patterns of relationships between one or more items in a dataset.
With the a priori algorithm, we can know the purchasing pattern of a consumer.

For example, in a minimarket if a consumer buys items A and B, 86% of the possibility he / she will buy item C.
